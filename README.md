# Pseudoregalia Map Tracker (AP)

This is a map tracker pack designed for use with the Archipelago implementation of Pseudoregalia.
This pack features location/item auto-tracking by connecting to the Archipelago server.

## Installation

Visit the `Releases` page for the latest/greatest, download, and then move the zip into `/poptracker/packs`. This pack does include auto-updating, so once you download the pack once, anytime there is an update, Poptracker will prompt you with an update.

## Connecting to AP

To connect to the AP server for auto-tracking, click on the `AP` button at the top of the tracker and a seperate window should pop up asking for you to "__enter archipelago server port__", in which you should type in `archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER` (or whatever ip/port combination you're connecting to), select `OK` and then continue to enter in your __Slot name__ and the __password__ to the room (if there is one). Once complete, the `AP` button at the top of the tracker window should turn "Green" meaning you are now auto-tracking!
